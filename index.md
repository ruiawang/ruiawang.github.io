## welcome to my site!
I'm a software engineer at [Google](https://about.google/company-info/), working on infrastructure for high-performance computing and AI/ML clusters.
Previously, I was a data scientist at [KraftHeinz](https://www.kraftheinz.com/) implementing and deploying machine learning models in manufacturing plants.
